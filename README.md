# FoodFuse

FoodFuse is an app created with Django, Python, and Selenium. The intent of the app is to save money and time, especially during times of a pandemic.

We all know the frustration of trying to find which app delivers our favorite restaurant/food. We also know the frustration of trying to find which app has the cheapest delivery fees and shortest delivery times. FoodFuse solves all of that. 

FoodFuse searches and sorts through the 4 major food delivery apps Doordash, Uber Eats, Postmates, and Grubhub by the user's location and returns the data. FoodFuse will provide the users with a comparison of the delivery fee's and delivery times between each service so that the user can make an educated choice on which app to use.

Fun fact: FoodFuse utilizes the Pantone 2020 color of the year, Classic Blue. üòÅüî∑
