# FoodFuse

FoodFuse is an app created by [Cristina Nguyen](https://github.com/crnguyen) and [Tanner Leigh](https://github.com/thleigh) through Django, Python, and Selenium. It was created to save money and time, especially during times of a pandemic.

We all know the frustration of trying to find which app delivers our favorite restaurant/food. We also know the frustration of trying to find which app has the cheapest delivery fees and shortest delivery times. FoodFuse solves all of that. 

FoodFuse searches and sorts through the 4 major food delivery apps Doordash, Uber Eats, Postmates, and Grubhub by the user's location and returns the data. User's will also be able to search for their favorite restaurants and/or the types of food that they are craving. FoodFuse will provide the users with a comparison of the delivery fee's and delivery times between each service so that the user can make an educated choice on which app to use.

FoodFuse utilizes the Pantone 2020 color of the year, Classic blue to symbolize::::
